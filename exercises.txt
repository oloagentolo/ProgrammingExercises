1. Write a program that takes a string input from the user and performs capitalization of the words in
   accordance with the following rules:
   
    a. Always capitalize the first word
    b. Always capitalize the last word
    c. Lowercase the following unless (a) or (b): a, the, to, at, in, with, and, but, or
    d. Uppercase any word not in (c)
    e. Empty strings don't qualify as words



2. Write a program that reverses the order of words in a string.  For example, an input string such as
  "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." should return
  "dog. lazy the over jumps fox brown quick The"

3. You are given an array with integers between 1 and 1000000. One of the integers is in the array twice.
   How can you determine which one?

   Solution: You know the end value of the array, which is 1000000.  Using the series sum formula
   where 1 + 2 + 3 + .. + n = n(n+1)/2, we can calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 1000000 without the
   duplicates.  Let this sum be y.  Let the sum of the given array with a duplicate value be x.  Then when
   we perform x - y, the result we are left with is the duplicated number in question.

*4. You are given an array of numbers (e.g. { -10, 2, 3, -2, 0, 5, -15 }). Find the largest sum of
    contiguous numbers in the array. Note that there might be more than one set of contiguous numbers, in
    which that case you must take the max sum of all sets. A set that contains no contiguous numbers should
    just return the largest number in the array.
